TC_INV_002,"Check the functionality of the sorting dropdown by selecting options like ""Name (A to Z)"", ""Name (Z to A)"", ""Price (low to high)"", and ""Price (high to low)"".","The list of products should rearrange correctly based on the selected sort option, ensuring accurate alphabetical or price-based sorting.","Name sorting (A-Z and Z-A) works correctly. However, price sorting is inconsistent - products are not sorted correctly by price values when 'low to high' or 'high to low' options are selected.",Fail,"While name-based sorting functions correctly, the price-based sorting appears to be malfunctioning. Product prices seem to change randomly on different page loads, and the sorting order does not follow the expected price sequence. This may be a bug in the application's sorting algorithm or potentially intentional test data behavior."
